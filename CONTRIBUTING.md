# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Default solution files are provided for Visual Studio 2015, however you can also use CMake to generate project files for any supported
editor of your choice (e.g. a different version of Visual Studio, a different platform, etc.)
** To build project files with CMake, simply open the run CMake on the root CMakeLists.txt. If you're using Windows, cmake-gui is recommended
for an easy way to select project options.
